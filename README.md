## About Me

I'm Calvin Anacia Suciawan, an undergraduate at Bina Nusantara University, with a focus on Mobile Application and Technology. Experienced in developing Android, iOS, and Web that includes building user-friendly, efficient, and visually appealing apps. I'm deeply committed to expanding my knowledge in this field.

## Activities

### HIMTI Greater Jakarta (2022 - 2023)
Himpunan Mahasiswa Teknik Informatika is a community for Computer Science students in Bina Nusantara University. I was involved in Division III - Web Developer team and took part in developing HIMTI Colaboration Web 2022.

### Friends Care Community (2023 - Now)
Sharing awareness about mental health and helping those who are mentally in need are part of our responsibilities as a BINUS SASC's (Student Advisory and Support Center) subunit. I'm currently positioned as a Creative Team member that creates and manages the community's social media posts.

### Ureeka (2023 - Now)
Developing coding skills is more than just taking part in classes. By joining Ureeka, I'm glad to learn more and gain some experience in many competitions. One of the experiences was taken when I participated in SOCS Hackathon 2023.
